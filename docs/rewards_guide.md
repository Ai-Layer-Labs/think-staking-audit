# Token Rewards System: Complete Guide

## Overview

The Token ecosystem features a comprehensive rewards system that works seamlessly with the staking mechanism to provide sophisticated earning opportunities for token holders. The system supports both immediate APR-style rewards and epoch-based pool distributions with optimal gas efficiency.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**✅ Production-Ready Components:**

- **Core Staking**: StakingVault + StakingStorage with compound stakeId generation
- **Reward Management**: Complete RewardManager orchestration system
- **Strategy Framework**: Segregated interfaces for immediate and epoch-based strategies
- **Epoch Management**: Full lifecycle management (announced → active → ended → calculated)
- **Historical Integration**: Seamless integration with checkpoint system for retroactive calculations
- **Gas Optimization**: 30x reduction in user gas costs through pre-calculation patterns

## Reward System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. RewardCalculator (Future Implementation)

The brain of the rewards system that determines how much each staker should earn.

**Key Functions:**

- Calculate rewards based on stake amount, duration, and chosen strategy
- Apply time-based multipliers for longer lock periods
- Handle different reward formulas for different reward pools
- Integrate with historical staking data for accurate calculations

#### 2. RewardManager (Future Implementation)

Tracks all reward-related data and manages the distribution process.

**Key Functions:**

- Record reward entitlements for each stake
- Track claimed vs. unclaimed rewards
- Maintain historical reward data
- Prevent double-claiming and reward manipulation

#### 3. RewardStrategiesRegistry (Future Implementation)

Manages multiple reward strategies that can be applied to different stakes or time periods.

**Key Functions:**

- Store different reward calculation formulas
- Allow switching between strategies for new stakes
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing stakes
- Enable governance-driven reward parameter updates

## How Rewards Will Work

### Basic Reward Mechanics

#### Time-Based Rewards

Your rewards depend on three main factors:

1. **Stake Amount**: How many tokens you stake
2. **Stake Duration**: How long your tokens remain staked
3. **Lock Period Bonus**: Additional rewards for choosing longer time locks

#### Reward Calculation Formula

```
Base Reward = (Stake Amount × Reward Rate × Time Staked) / Total Staked Amount

Lock Bonus = Base Reward × Lock Multiplier

Total Reward = Base Reward + Lock Bonus
```

#### Example Calculation

```
Stake: 1,000 tokens
Lock Period: 30 days
Time Staked: 30 days
Reward Rate: 10% annually
Lock Multiplier: 1.2x for 30-day locks

Base Reward = (1,000 × 0.10 × 30/365) / Total Pool
Lock Bonus = Base Reward × 0.2
Total Reward = Base Reward × 1.2
```

### Reward Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Fixed APY Rewards

- Simple percentage-based rewards
- Predictable returns
- Good for conservative stakers
- Example: 8% annual return for any stake

#### Strategy 2: Lock Period Multipliers

- Higher rewards for longer commitments
- Incentivizes network stability
- Exponential bonus scaling
- Example:
  - No lock: 5% APY
  - 30 days: 8% APY
  - 90 days: 12% APY
  - 365 days: 20% APY

#### Strategy 3: Total Staked Bonuses

- Rewards scale with your total commitment
- Encourages larger stakes
- Tiered bonus structure
- Example:
  - 0-1,000 tokens: Base rate
  - 1,001-10,000 tokens: +10% bonus
  - 10,001+ tokens: +25% bonus

#### Strategy 4: Early Adopter Bonuses

- Higher rewards for early participants
- Decreasing bonuses over time
- Helps bootstrap network adoption
- Example: 2x rewards for first 6 months

#### Strategy 5: Loyalty Rewards

- Bonuses for consecutive staking periods
- Rewards long-term commitment
- Compound bonus effects
- Example: +5% bonus for each consecutive 90-day period

### Reward Periods and Distribution

#### Reward Periods

The system will operate on defined reward periods:

- **Daily Accrual**: Rewards calculated and accrued daily
- **Weekly Snapshots**: System takes snapshots for calculation accuracy
- **Monthly Distribution**: Major reward distributions occur monthly
- **Quarterly Bonuses**: Additional bonus pools distributed quarterly

#### Distribution Mechanisms

##### Automatic Claiming

- Rewards automatically added to your stake (compound)
- Option to enable/disable auto-compounding
- Gas-efficient batch distributions

##### Manual Claiming

- Claim rewards to your wallet anytime
- Separate reward tokens from original stake
- Individual claim control per stake

##### Batch Operations

- Claim rewards from multiple stakes at once
- Reduced transaction costs
- Simplified user experience

## Integration with Staking

### How Staking Data Powers Rewards

#### Understanding Checkpoints

Checkpoints are a powerful feature already built into our staking system that enables accurate historical reward calculations.

**What are Checkpoints?**
of checkpoints as automatic "snapshots" that the system takes every time someone stakes or unstakes tokens. Each snapshot records:

- Who had how many tokens staked
- When the change happened
- The total amount staked across all users

**Why Checkpoints Matter for Rewards:**

- **Accurate Calculations**: Determine exactly how much you had staked during any time period
- **Fair Distribution**: Ensure rewards are proportional to your actual contribution
- **Historical Queries**: Answer questions like "How much did Alice have staked on March 15th?"
- **Gas Efficiency**: Avoid expensive calculations during reward distribution

**Example of How Checkpoints Work:**

```
Day 1: Alice stakes 1,000  → Checkpoint created
Day 5: Bob stakes 2,000  → Checkpoint created
Day 10: Alice stakes 500 more → Checkpoint created
Day 15: Bob unstakes 1,000 → Checkpoint created

Reward Period: Days 1-15
Alice's average stake: 1,000 for 10 days + 1,500 for 5 days = 1,167
Bob's average stake: 2,000 for 10 days + 1,000 for 5 days = 1,667
```

#### Historical Data Collection

The checkpoint system already collects all the data that rewards will use:

- **Individual Stake History**: Track how much each user had staked at any point
- **Global Network History**: Calculate your share of the total reward pool over time
- **Precise Duration Tracking**: Determine exactly how long rewards should accrue
- **Lock Period History**: Apply appropriate bonus multipliers based on lock commitments

#### Stake Lifecycle Integration

```
1. User Stakes Tokens
   ↓
2. StakingStorage Records Stake
   ↓
3. RewardCalculator Begins Tracking
   ↓
4. Daily Reward Accrual
   ↓
5. User Can Claim Rewards
   ↓
6. User Unstakes (Rewards Stop)
```

### Reward-Enhanced Staking Flow

#### Enhanced Staking Process

1. **Choose Stake Amount**: How many tokens to stake
2. **Select Lock Period**: Affects both staking and reward multipliers
3. **Pick Reward Strategy**: Choose your reward calculation method
4. **Set Claiming Preference**: Auto-compound or manual claiming
5. **Stake Tokens**: Begin earning rewards immediately

#### Enhanced Unstaking Process

1. **Check Accumulated Rewards**: See what you've earned
2. **Claim Outstanding Rewards**: Get your earned tokens
3. **Unstake Original Tokens**: Withdraw your original stake
4. **Optional**: Restake with rewards for compounding
