# Think Token Staking: Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Think Token staking system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between business logic and data storage. This design ensures security, efficiency, and maintainability.

### Core Components

#### 1. StakingVault (Business Logic Layer)

**Location**: `src/StakingVault.sol`
**Role**: Primary interface contract that handles all user interactions and business logic.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- **Token Management**: Handles IERC20 token transfers (deposits/withdrawals)
- **Stake Operations**: Creates and processes stake/unstake requests
- **Time Lock Enforcement**: Validates stake maturity before allowing unstaking
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Claim Contract)
- **Security**: Reentrancy protection, pause mechanism, emergency controls

**Key Features**:

- Immutable references to token and storage contracts
- Support for both direct staking and claim contract integration
- Emergency token recovery functionality
- Comprehensive event emission for transparency

#### 2. StakingStorage (Data Persistence Layer)

**Location**: `src/StakingStorage.sol`
**Role**: Dedicated storage contract that maintains all staking data and historical records.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- **Stake Management**: Creates, tracks, and manages individual stakes
- **Historical Data**: Maintains comprehensive checkpoint system
- **Balance Tracking**: Real-time and historical balance calculations
- **Global Statistics**: Network-wide staking metrics and snapshots
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized data retrieval with binary search algorithms

**Advanced Data Structures**:

- Checkpoint system for historical balance queries
- Binary search optimization for efficient historical lookups
- Paginated data access for large datasets
- Comprehensive daily snapshots for analytics

```

### Storage Design Patterns

#### Checkpoint System

The storage contract implements a sophisticated checkpoint mechanism that automatically records balance changes:

- **Automatic Snapshots**: Every stake/unstake creates a checkpoint
- **Binary Search Optimization**: Efficient historical balance queries
- **Gas Efficiency**: Minimizes storage operations while maximizing data availability
- **Historical Integrity**: Immutable record of all balance changes

#### Stake Lifecycle Management

Each stake follows a complete lifecycle with full traceability:

1. **Creation**: Unique ID generation, initial checkpoint
2. **Active Period**: Continuous balance tracking
3. **Maturation**: Time lock validation
4. **Completion**: Unstaking with final checkpoint

### Security Architecture

#### Multi-Layer Security

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for different operations
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against recursive call attacks
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency system shutdown capability
- **Time Lock Enforcement**: Immutable stake duration requirements
- **Emergency Recovery**: A feature controlled by a dedicated `MULTISIG_ROLE` to recover any ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract. This prevents loss of funds while ensuring the action is controlled by a secure, multi-signature entity, separate from the general admin role.

#### Separation of Concerns

- **StakingVault**: Handles external interactions and security checks
- **StakingStorage**: Manages data integrity and historical records
- **Clear Boundaries**: Minimizes attack surface through modular design
- **Strict Role-Based Access Control**: Sensitive operations are protected by specific roles. A `MANAGER_ROLE` handles operational pausing, while a unique `MULTISIG_ROLE` is exclusively assigned to the emergency recovery function. This granular control follows the principle of least privilege.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Key functions are guarded against reentrancy attacks using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
- **Pause Capability**: The system can be paused by a `MANAGER_ROLE` in case of an emergency, halting all primary functions like staking and unstaking.

## Integration Architecture

### Current System Integration

#### Token Integration

- **IERC20 Compatibility**: Works with any standard ERC20 token
- **SafeERC20 Usage**: Protection against non-standard token implementations
- **Immutable Token Reference**: Prevents token switching attacks

#### Claim Contract Integration

- **Dedicated Role**: `CLAIM_CONTRACT_ROLE` for external claiming systems
- **Flexible Staking**: Supports staking on behalf of users
- **Claim Marking**: Distinguishes between direct stakes and claim-originated stakes

### Future Integration Points

#### Reward System Integration

The current architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with the upcoming reward system:

- **Historical Data Ready**: Checkpoint system provides all necessary historical data
- **Reward Calculator Interface**: Storage contract exposes all required data points
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for reward calculation workloads

#### External Protocol Integration

- **Modular Design**: Easy integration with other DeFi protocols
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: External systems can monitor via events
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Follows common DeFi integration patterns

## Core Workflows

To understand how the system functions, here are the two primary user-facing interactions represented as sequence diagrams.

### Staking Flow (`stake`)

This diagram shows how a user's call to `stake` interacts across the different contracts to create a new stake.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant StakingVault
    participant ERC20
    participant StakingStorage

    User->>+StakingVault: stake(amount, daysLock)
    StakingVault->>+ERC20: safeTransferFrom(User, StakingVault, amount)
    ERC20-->>-StakingVault: (tokens transferred)
    StakingVault->>+StakingStorage: createStake(User, stakeId, amount, daysLock, false)
    StakingStorage-->>-StakingVault: (state updated)
    Note over StakingVault: Emits Staked event
    StakingVault-->>-User: returns stakeId
```

### Unstaking Flow (`unstake`)

This diagram illustrates the process of unstaking, including fetching the stake data, validation, and returning the tokens.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant StakingVault
    participant StakingStorage
    participant ERC20

    User->>+StakingVault: unstake(stakeId)
    StakingVault->>+StakingStorage: getStake(User, stakeId)
    StakingStorage-->>-StakingVault: returns Stake data
    Note over StakingVault: Validates stake maturity<br/>and status
    StakingVault->>+StakingStorage: removeStake(User, stakeId)
    StakingStorage-->>-StakingVault: (state updated)
    StakingVault->>+ERC20: safeTransfer(User, amount)
    ERC20-->>-StakingVault: (tokens transferred)
    Note over StakingVault: Emits Unstaked event
    StakingVault-->>-User: (unstake complete)
```

## Key Features

- **Flexible Staking**: Users can create multiple stakes with different time lock periods.
