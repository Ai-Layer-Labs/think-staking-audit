# THINK Token Staking System: Use Cases

## Overview

This document defines use cases for the STAKING SUBSYSTEM ONLY. The reward system is under development and excluded from current audit scope.

## Core Staking System Components

- **StakingVault.sol**: Business logic and user interface contract
- **StakingStorage.sol**: Data persistence and historical tracking contract
- **Token.sol**: THINK (ERC20) test token

## User Use Cases

### UC1: Direct Token Staking

**Actor**: Regular User  
**Description**: User stakes their tokens with a specified time lock period  
**Contracts**: StakingVault, StakingStorage

**Preconditions**:

- User has sufficient token balance
- User has approved StakingVault to spend their tokens
- Contract is not paused
- Amount is greater than zero
- Time lock is valid (uint16, can be 0 for no lock)

**Flow**:

1. User calls `StakingVault.stake(uint128 amount, uint16 daysLock)`
2. Vault validates parameters and transfers tokens from user
3. Vault generates unique stake ID: `keccak256(abi.encode(staker, stakesCount))`
4. Vault calls `StakingStorage.createStake(staker, stakeId, amount, daysLock, false)`
5. Storage creates stake record and updates checkpoints

**Postconditions**:

- User's tokens are transferred to StakingVault
- Stake is recorded in StakingStorage with unique stake ID
- User's `stakesCount` is incremented
- User's `totalStaked` amount is updated
- Global total staked amount is updated
- Checkpoint is created for historical tracking
- Daily snapshot is updated
- `Staked` event is emitted from both contracts

### UC2: Stake Unstaking

**Actor**: Regular User  
**Description**: User unstakes their matured tokens and receives them back  
**Contracts**: StakingVault, StakingStorage

**Preconditions**:

- User has an active stake with the specified stake ID
- Current day >= stake day + days lock (`_getCurrentDay() >= matureDay`)
- Contract is not paused
- Stake hasn't been previously unstaked (`unstakeDay == 0`)

**Flow**:

1. User calls `StakingVault.unstake(bytes32 stakeId)`
2. Vault retrieves stake via `StakingStorage.getStake(msg.sender, stakeId)`. Stake ownership is implicitly validated here; if `msg.sender` is not the owner, the stake will not be found.
3. Vault validates stake maturity
4. Vault calls `StakingStorage.removeStake(msg.sender, stakeId)`
5. Storage marks stake as unstaked (sets `unstakeDay`) and updates balances
6. Vault transfers tokens back to user

**Postconditions**:

- Stake is marked as unstaked in StakingStorage (`unstakeDay` set)
- User's `stakesCount` is decremented
- User's `totalStaked` amount is updated
- Global total staked amount is updated
- Checkpoint is created with reduced balance
- Daily snapshot is updated
- Tokens are transferred back to user
- `Unstaked` event is emitted from both contracts

## Notes for Auditors

1. **Reward System Excluded**: This audit focuses solely on the staking subsystem. Reward contracts are incomplete and should be excluded.

2. **Key Security Areas**:

   - Time lock validation logic
   - Access control enforcement
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Historical data integrity

3. **Critical Functions**:

   - `StakingVault.stake()`
   - `StakingVault.unstake()`
   - `StakingStorage.createStake()`
   - `StakingStorage.removeStake()`
   - Historical query functions

4. **Gas Optimization**: Binary search implementation in checkpoint system for efficient historical queries.

5. **Immutable Design**: Core contracts are immutable once deployed, enhancing security but requiring careful deployment.
