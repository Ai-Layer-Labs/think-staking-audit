## Core Staking Function Tests

### TC1: Successful Direct Stake (UC1)

```gherkin

    And user has sufficient token balance (>= stake amount)
    And user has approved StakingVault to spend tokens (>= stake amount)
    And stake amount is greater than zero
    And days lock is valid uint16 value
    When user calls StakingVault.stake(amount, daysLock)
    Then tokens should be transferred from user to StakingVault
    And unique stake ID should be generated using compound key: bytes32((uint256(uint160(staker)) << 96) | stakesCounter)
    And StakingStorage.createStake should be called with correct parameters
    And stake should be recorded with isFromClaim = false
    And user's stakesCount should be incremented
    And user's totalStaked should be increased by amount
    And global currentTotalStaked should be increased by amount
    And checkpoint should be created for current day
    And daily snapshot should be updated

    And the staking system is not paused
    And stake has not been previously unstaked (unstakeDay == 0)
    When user calls StakingVault.unstake(stakeId)
    Then StakingStorage.getStake should be called to retrieve stake details
    And time lock validation should pass
    And StakingStorage.removeStake should be called
    And stake should be marked as unstaked (unstakeDay set to current day)
    And user's stakesCount should be decremented
    And user's totalStaked should be decreased by stake amount
    And global currentTotalStaked should be decreased by stake amount

## Summary

This document defines **62 focused test cases** for the complete Token Staking System:

- **Core Staking Tests (TC1-TC28)**: 28 test cases covering StakingVault and StakingStorage with focus on business logic
- **Reward System Tests (TC_R01-TC_R30)**: 30 test cases covering complete reward functionality
- **Flag System Tests (TC_F01-TC_F03)**: 3 test cases for extensible flag operations
- **Integration Tests (TC_I01-TC_I07)**: 7 simplified test cases for cross-system integration

Each test case focuses on business logic and core functionality rather than implementation details or external library testing. The test cases provide practical coverage of all use cases defined in `use_cases.md` and ensure the system is audit-ready without over-engineering.
