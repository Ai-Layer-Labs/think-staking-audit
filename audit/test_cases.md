# THINK Token Staking System: Test Cases

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive test cases for the STAKING SUBSYSTEM ONLY. Test cases are mapped to use cases defined in `use_cases.md` and cover the current implementation of StakingVault and StakingStorage contracts.

**Note**: Tests are currently outdated and need to be rewritten based on these specifications.

## Core Staking Function Tests

### TC1: Successful Direct Stake (UC1)

```gherkin
Feature: Direct Token Staking
  Scenario: User successfully stakes tokens with time lock
    Given the staking system is not paused
    And user has sufficient token balance (>= stake amount)
    And user has approved StakingVault to spend tokens (>= stake amount)
    And stake amount is greater than zero
    And days lock is valid uint16 value
    When user calls StakingVault.stake(amount, daysLock)
    Then tokens should be transferred from user to StakingVault
    And unique stake ID should be generated using keccak256(abi.encode(staker, stakesCount))
    And StakingStorage.createStake should be called with correct parameters
    And stake should be recorded with isFromClaim = false
    And user's stakesCount should be incremented
    And user's totalStaked should be increased by amount
    And global currentTotalStaked should be increased by amount
    And checkpoint should be created for current day
    And daily snapshot should be updated
    And Staked event should be emitted from both contracts
    And stake ID should be returned to caller
```

### TC2: Successful Unstaking (UC2)

```gherkin
Feature: Token Unstaking
  Scenario: User successfully unstakes matured tokens
    Given user has an active stake with valid stake ID
    And current day >= stake day + days lock (time lock expired)
    And the staking system is not paused
    And stake has not been previously unstaked (unstakeDay == 0)
    When user calls StakingVault.unstake(stakeId)
    Then StakingStorage.getStake should be called to retrieve stake details
    And time lock validation should pass
    And StakingStorage.removeStake should be called
    And stake should be marked as unstaked (unstakeDay set to current day)
    And user's stakesCount should be decremented
    And user's totalStaked should be decreased by stake amount
    And global currentTotalStaked should be decreased by stake amount
    And checkpoint should be created with reduced balance
    And daily snapshot should be updated
    And tokens should be transferred back to user
    And Unstaked event should be emitted from both contracts
```

    And no stake should be created
    And no state should be modified
```

### TC5: Failed Staking - Zero Amount (UC12)

```gherkin
Feature: Amount Validation
  Scenario: User attempts to stake zero tokens

```

### TC35: Stake ID Generation Validation

```gherkin
Feature: Stake ID Generation
  Scenario: Deterministic stake ID generation
    Given specific staker and stakesCount
    When stake() is called multiple times

    Then no overflow should occur
    And calculations should remain accurate

  Scenario: Same-day multiple operations

```gherkin
Feature: Event Emission Coordination
  Scenario: Vault and Storage event synchronization

    Given batch operations with large arrays
    When batchGetStakerBalances is called
    Then operation should succeed or fail gracefully
    And partial results should not corrupt state

    And stake IDs should match expected stakes
    And boundary conditions should be handled correctly

  Scenario: Empty results for duration queries
    Given staker has no stakes meeting duration criteria

    And some stakes were unstaked on day 115
    When getActiveStakesOnDay(staker, 113) is called
    Then only stakes active on day 113 should be returned
    And unstaked stakes should be excluded correctly
    And stakes not yet created should be excluded

  Scenario: Query stakes by duration criteria on specific day
    Given staker had multiple stakes active on day 150
    And stakes had different durations as of day 150
    When getStakesByDurationOnDay(staker, 150, 20, true) is called
    Then only stakes with duration >= 20 days as of day 150 should be returned

    And includeGreater parameter should filter correctly

  Scenario: Edge case - query for future day
    Given current day is 200

  Scenario: Large dataset performance
    Given staker has 1000+ stakes
    When temporal queries are performed
    Then operations should complete efficiently
    And gas usage should be reasonable
    And results should be accurate
```

### TC48: Counter-Based Enumeration Validation

```gherkin
Feature: Enumeration System Integrity
  Scenario: Counter increment consistency
    Given staker creates multiple stakes
    When stakes are created sequentially
    Then _stakeCount should increment correctly
    And _stakeByIndex mappings should be populated correctly
    And enumeration should include all stakes

  Scenario: Enumeration after unstaking
    Given staker has multiple stakes and unstakes some
    When temporal queries are performed
    Then both active and unstaked stakes should be enumerated
    And unstaked stakes should be properly identified
    And historical data should remain accessible

  Scenario: Index-based access validation
    Given staker has N stakes
    When iterating through indices 0 to N-1
    Then all stake IDs should be retrievable
    And no index should return empty/invalid stake ID
    And enumeration should be complete and accurate
```

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: TC1, TC2, TC3, TC6, TC11, TC23, TC24, TC27, TC34, TC35, TC37, TC39, TC44, TC45, TC48 (Core functionality and security)
- **High**: TC4, TC5, TC8, TC9, TC13-TC17, TC19-TC22, TC25, TC26, TC36, TC38, TC40, TC41, TC46, TC47 (Important features and validations)
- **Medium**: TC7, TC10, TC12, TC18, TC28-TC31, TC42, TC43 (Edge cases and optimizations)
- **Low**: TC32, TC33 (Events and gas optimization verification)

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing (TC1-TC5, TC13-TC17, TC34-TC35, TC38, TC41, TC44-TC48)
2. **Integration Tests**: Contract interaction testing (TC27, TC28, TC42)
3. **Security Tests**: Attack vector testing (TC23, TC24, TC34)
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary condition testing (TC29-TC31, TC36-TC37, TC39-TC41, TC43, TC47)
5. **Performance Tests**: Gas and efficiency testing (TC33, TC37, TC43, TC44, TC47)

### Coverage Requirements

- **Function Coverage**: 100% of public/external functions
- **Branch Coverage**: 100% of conditional logic paths
- **Edge Case Coverage**: All error conditions and boundary cases
- **Integration Coverage**: All contract interactions
- **Event Coverage**: All event emissions verified

### Notes for Test Implementation

1. Tests should be implemented using Foundry framework
2. Use proper setup/teardown for consistent test state
3. Mock external dependencies where appropriate
4. Implement helper functions for common operations
5. Use fuzz testing for numeric edge cases
6. Verify gas usage doesn't exceed expected limits
7. Test both success and failure scenarios for each function
