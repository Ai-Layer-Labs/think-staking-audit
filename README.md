## System Overview

This staking platform is built with three core principles: security, data integrity, and developer-friendliness.

### Key Features

- **Security First**: Multi-layered security with role-based access control, including a dedicated `MULTISIG_ROLE` for critical recovery operations. It is protected from reentrancy attacks and can be paused in emergencies.
- **Advanced Data Management**: Uses a checkpoint system and binary search for highly-efficient historical balance queries (`O(log n)`), alongside individual stake tracking and daily statistical snapshots.
- **Developer Friendly**: A modular architecture separates logic (`StakingVault`) from data (`StakingStorage`), providing well-defined interfaces and gas-optimized operations to encourage ecosystem expansion.
