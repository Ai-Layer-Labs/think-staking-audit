## System Overview

This staking platform is built with three core principles: security, data integrity, and developer-friendliness.

### Key Features

- **Security First**: Multi-layered security with role-based access control, including a dedicated `MULTISIG_ROLE` for critical recovery operations. It is protected from reentrancy attacks and can be paused in emergencies.
- **Flexible Reward System**: A fully modular reward architecture with distinct contracts for scheduling (`PoolManager`), orchestration (`RewardManager`), and claim history (`ClaimsJournal`). This allows for creating complex reward scenarios with different strategies.
- **Advanced Data Management**: Uses a checkpoint system for highly-efficient historical balance queries (`O(log n)`), which provides the necessary data for fair and accurate reward calculations.
- **Developer Friendly**: A clear separation of concerns between the staking core and the reward system, providing well-defined interfaces to encourage ecosystem expansion.

### Project Status

The core staking and reward systems are feature-complete and ready for audit. The architecture supports two types of reward strategies, `POOL_SIZE_INDEPENDENT` (e.g., APR-based) and `POOL_SIZE_DEPENDENT` (e.g., shared reward pools), providing extensive flexibility for future reward programs.
